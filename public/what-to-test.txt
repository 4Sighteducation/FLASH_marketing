FL4SH — What to Test (quick checklist)

A) Getting started
- Onboarding: exam track selection makes sense (GCSE/A-Level + Scottish where relevant)
- Subject selection: easy to find subjects, search works, nothing missing
- Topic discovery: topic tree feels right, search relevance is good

B) Flashcards
- AI generation: quality + exam relevance across MCQ / Short Answer / Essay / Acronym
- Manual create/edit/delete: reliable saving and editing

C) Study (core loop)
- Start study session → answer → grade → next card (smooth, no weird jumps)
- Cards Due / Leitner: due counts update correctly and feel fair
- Card Bank vs Study Bank: is it clear without explanation?

D) Progress
- Progress updates after study; weak areas are obvious

E) Pro features (waitlisters should have Pro enabled)
- Past Papers: open papers/questions/mark schemes (where available)
- Timed practice: timer behaves, results make sense

F) Account + reliability
- Sign up / login / password reset works and errors are clear
- Performance: start-up, resume, navigation speed; any crashes
